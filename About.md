title: About
---
I come from France, more spcifically from a cold and beautiful place called 
"Vosges". Since 2022, I live in New York City and I am a Scientific Software Engineer and Neural Engineer.

For those who don't really know what "Neural Engineer" means: 
I discovered this term when I was working at the City College of New York under 
the supervision of [Pr. Jacek Dmochowski](https://dmochow.github.io/about/) 
and I thought this term describes quite well my profile.
- **Neural:** I hold a PhD in Health and Life Science with a 
concentration in Human Neuroscience, intracerebral (invasive)
electro-encephalography. You can find my PhD work [here](https://docnum.univ-lorraine.fr/public/DDOC_T_2022_0102_LOUVIOT.pdf)
(25 first pages are the summary in French but the rest is in English)
tools for innovative treatments of neurological diseases.
- **Engineer:** I have an associate degree in electrical engineering, a 
B.Sc and M.Sc in Biomedical Engineering (with a concentration 
in Cybernetics/Robotics, softwares engineering, instrumentation, 
and image for biology and medicine).

I am passionate about science and engineering, learning, coding, soldering, 
playing around with my 3 RaspberryPi. 
I love nature and try my best to orient all my actions 
toward the protection of our planet. 

# What "SystemD"?
The name has 2 origins:
1. The name comes from a french expression "Système D" for "Système débrouille" 
which is a big part of the french culture. 
It means that, when facing challenges, you can put together a solution 
with only the few resssources that are available to you. 
As a former military (Gendarme) I heard,and applied this term A LOT!. 
If "Système D" was a fictional character, it would be MacGyver. 

Here are some nice resources that explain very well "Système D":
- ["Système D" from the blog "FranceSays"](https://francesays.com/2015/04/09/systeme-d/)
- [definition from the Collins dictionnary](https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/french-english/système-d)

2. systemd in GNU/Linux is a system and service manager:
